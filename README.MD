## Features

- **Like Google**
-- QMean can detect similar words even if they contain typos! This feature will work on both AJAX suggestions and after the query is searched by showing "Did You Mean: Right Keywords"
- **Offer Query Suggestions**
-- QMean will search through database and collect keywords and phrases related to the given input. You are the one who decides where to look: Titles, Excerpts, Contents, Taxonomy Terms or PostMetas and on which post types, comments, posts, pages and ... 
- **Modes: Phrase or Word By Word**
-- QMean can interact by any word user enters individually and completes the query or offer them phrases base on the whole input. Each one has its own advantages so you can set the one suits you.

-- A search field shortcode and a did you mean search suggestion
- **Just "CSS Selector" To Hook**
-- QMean just needs the selector of your search input which can hook itself to it and provides the suggestions. It has a special tool, QMean field recognizer, to find the selector on you theme
- **Settings and Styling**
-- You can position and style the box as you wish via settings
- **Stop Words Removal**
-- QMean can detect stop words and remove them on both the query the result 

We developed this plugin because:

> Lots of wordpress websites have the related results but they can not find it because of user typos and not the right words!
> If you know the language used in a website you can search through it easily. So, we only suggest the best words and phrases relative to any website using QMean

## How This Works!?
QMean doesn't care if you typed "hodei wth", "hdie wih" or "hode whi" it is smart enough to determine that you are looking for "Hoodie with". In most cases even the wrong order of words can't fail the suggestion. Depending on your selected mode it can help user to complete the phrase, word by word or show them complete phrased suggestions at the beginning!
